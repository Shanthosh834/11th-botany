This section deals with the vascular tissue system of gymnosperms and angiosperms stems and roots.The vascular tissue system consists of xylem and phloem. The elements of xylem and phloem are always organized in groups. They are called **vascular bundles.**

The stems of both groups have an eustele while roots are protostele. In eustelic organization, the stele contains usually a ring of vascular bundles separated by interfascicular region or medullary ray

The structural and organizational variation in vascular bundles is shown below.
