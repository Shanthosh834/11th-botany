As a traveller you would have got a chance to observe the plants. It is an interesting fact that all plants are not alike. Just spend some time to observe the nature. You can notice plants with attractive leaves, flowers and fruits.

Can you say all plants are healthy and uniform in growth? Some plants are not healthy and show symptoms like texture changes, stunted growth, chlorosis, necrosis and so on. Can you tell what is the reason

for all these symptoms? It may be due to infection of microbial pathogens or climatic factors or due to mineral deficiency.

In this chapter we are going to learn about classification of minerals, their functions, deficiency diseases and symptoms, nitrogen metabolism and special modes of nutrition. Further, how can these ideas help us to improve productivity in agriculture?

Plants naturally obtain nutrients from atmosphere, water and soil. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are called as skeletal elements and constitute about 94% of dry weight. These elements play an important role in the formation of organic compounds such as carbohydrates, fats and protein. These non-mineral elements are obtained from air and water. Minerals are classified based on essentiality. **Arnon** and **Stout** (1939) gave criteria required for essential minerals:

1. Elements necessary for growth and development.
2. They should have direct role in the metabolism of the plant.
3. It cannot be replaced by other elements.
4. Deficiency makes the plants impossible to complete their vegetative and reproductive phase.

## Classification of minerals

### Classification of minerals based on their quantity requirements

Essential elements are classified as **Macro-nutrients, Micronutrients** and **Unclassified minerals** based on their

**Table 12.1: Mineral Types**

|                                      Macro nutrients                                      |                                           Micro nutrients                                            |                            Unclassified minerals                            |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Excess than 10 mmole Kg-1 in tissue concentration or 0.1 to 10 mg per gram of dry weight. | Less than 10 mmole Kg-1 in tissue concentration or equal or less than 0.1 mg per gram of dry weight. | Required for some plants in trace amounts and have some specific functions. |
|                          Example: C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S                          |                              Example: Fe, Mn, Cu, Mo, Zn, B, Cl and Ni                               |                Example: Sodium, Cobalt, Silicon and Selenium                |

requirements. Essential minerals which are required in higher concentration are called Macronutrients. Essential minerals which are required in less concentration called are as Micronutrients.

Minerals like Sodium, Silicon, Cobalt and Selenium are not included in the list of essential nutrients but are required by some plants, these minerals are placed in the list of unclassified minerals. These minerals play specific roles for example, Silicon is essential for pest resistance, prevent water lodging and aids cell wall formation in Equisetaceae (_Equisetum_), Cyperaceae and Gramineae (Table 12. 1).

### Classification of minerals based on mobility

If you observe where the deficiency symptoms appear first, you can notice differences in old and younger leaves. It is mainly due to mobility of minerals. Based on this, they are classified into 1. Actively mobile minerals and 2. Relatively immobile minerals (Figure 12.1).

**a. Actively mobile minerals** Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Magnesium, Chlorine, Sodium, Zinc and Molybdenum.

Deficiency symptoms first appear on old and senescent leaves due to active movement of minerals to younger leaves.

**b. Relatively immobile minerals** Calcium, Sulphur, Iron, Boron and Copper shows deficiency symptoms first that appear
on young leaves due to the immobile nature of minerals

![ Mobility of Minerals](12.1.png)

### Classification of minerals based on their functions

**a. Structural component minerals**: Minerals like Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen

**b. Enzyme function**: Molybdenum (Mo) is essential for nitrogenase enzyme during reduction of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. Zinc (Zn)is an important activator for alcohol dehydrogenase and carbonic anhydrase. Magnesium (Mg) is the activator for RUBP carboxylase- oxygenase and PEP carboxylase. Nickel (Ni) is a constituent of urease and hydrogenase.

**c. Osmotic Potential:** Potassium (K) plays a key role in maintaining osmotic potential of the cell. The absorption of water, movement of stomata and turgidity are due to osmotic potential.

**d. Energy components**: Magnesium (Mg) in chlorophyll and phosphorous (P) in ATP.

## Functions, mode of absorption and deficiency symptoms of micronutrients

Micronutrients even though required in trace amounts are essential for the metabolism of plants. They play key roles in many plants. Example: Boron is essential for translocation of sugars, molybdenum is involved in nitrogen metabolism and zinc is needed for biosynthesis of auxin. Here, we will study about the role of micro nutrients, their functions, their mode of absorption, deficiency symptoms and deficiency diseases.

## Deficiency diseases and symptoms

The following table (Table 12.2) gives you an idea about Minerals and their Deficiency symptoms:

## Critical concentration and toxicity of minerals

### Critical Concentration

To increase the productivity and also to avoid mineral toxicity knowledge of critical concentration is essential. Mineral nutrients lesser than critical concentration cause deficiency symptoms. Increase of mineral nutrients more than the normal concentration causes toxicity. A concentration, at which 10 % of the dry weight of tissue is reduced, is considered as toxic. Figure ##12.2 explains about Critical Concentration.

![Alt text](image.png)

### Mineral Toxicity

**a. Manganese toxicity**
Increased Concentration of Manganese will prevent the uptake of Fe and Mg, prevent translocation of Ca to the shoot apex and cause their deficiency. The symptoms of manganese toxicity are appearance of brown spots surrounded by chlorotic veins.
####b. Aluminium Toxicity
Aluminium toxicity causes precipitation of nucleic acid, inhibition of ATPase, inhibition of cell division and binding of plasma membrane with Calmodulin.For theories regarding, translocation of minerals please refer Chapter- 11.

## Hydroponics and Aeroponics

**1. Hydroponics or Soilless culture:Von Sachs** developed a method of growing plants in nutrient solution. The commonly used nutrient solutions are **Knop solution** (1865) and **Arnon** and **Hoagland** **Solution** (1940). Later the term Hydroponics was coined by **Goerick** (1940) and he also introduced commercial techniques for hydroponics. In hydroponics roots are immersed in the solution containing nutrients and air is supplied with help of tube (Figure 12.3).

![Alt text](image-1.png)

**Aeroponics:** This technique was developed by **Soifer Hillel** and **David Durger**. It is a system where roots are suspended in air and nutrients are sprayed over the roots by a motor driven rotor (Figure 12.4).

## NITROGEN FIXATION

Inspiring act of nature is self-regulation. As all living organisms act as tools for biogeochemical cycles, nitrogen cycle is highly regulated. Life on earth depends on nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen occurs in atmosphere in the form of N2 (N≡N), two nitrogen atoms joined together by strong triple covalent bonds. The process of converting atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia is termed as nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation can occur by two methods: 1. Biological; 2. Non-Biological (Figure 12.5).

### Non – Biological nitrogen fixation

- Nitrogen fixation by chemical process inindustry.
- Natural electrical discharge during
  lightening fixes atmospheric nitrogen.

### Biological nitrogen fixation

Symbiotic bacterium like _Rhizobium_ fixes atmospheric nitrogen. Cyanobacteria found in Lichens, _Anthoceros, Azolla_ and coralloid roots of _Cycas_ also fix nitrogen. Non-symbiotic (free living bacteria) like _Clostridium_ also fix nitrogen.

**a. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation**
**i. Nitrogen fixation with nodulation**
_Rhizobium_ bacterium is found in leguminous plants and fix atmospheric nitrogen. This kind of symbiotic association is beneficial for both the bacterium and plant. Root nodules are formed due to bacterial infection. _Rhizobium_ enters into the host cell and proliferates, it remains separated from the host cytoplasm by a membrane (Figure 12.6).

**Stages of Root nodule formation**_:_

1. Legume plants secretes phenolics which
   attracts _Rhizobium_.
2. _Rhizobium_ reaches the rhizosphere and
   enters into the root hair, infects the root hair and leads to curling of root hairs.
3. Infection thread grows inwards and separates the infected tissue from normal tissue.

![Alt text](image-3.png)

4.A membrane bound bacterium is formed inside the nodule and is called bacteroid.
5.Cytokinin from bacteria and auxin from host plant promotes cell division and leads to nodule formation

**Non-Legume** _Alnus and Casuarina_ contain the bacterium _Frankia. Psychotria_ contains the bacterium _Klebsiella_.
**ii. Nitrogen fixation without nodulation** The following plants and prokaryotes are involved in nitrogen fixation.

Lichens - Anabaena and Nostoc
Anthoceros - Nostoc
Azolla - Anabaena azollae
Cycas - Anabaena and Nostoc

**b. Non-symbiotic Nitrogen fixation**
Free living bacteria and fungi also fix atmospheric nitrogen.
|:-------------: | |:-----------: |
| Aerobic | Azotobacter, Beijerinckia and\_\_Derxia|
| Anaerobic | Clostridium |
Photosynthetic | Chlorobium and Rhodospirillum |
| Chemosynthetic | Disulfovibrio |
Free living fungi | Yeast and Pullularia |
|Cyanobacteria | Nostoc, Anabaena and Oscillatoria.|

## Nitrogen cycle and nitrogen metabolism

### Nitrogen cycle

This cycle consists of following stages:
**1.Fixation of atmospheric nitrogen**
Di-nitrogen molecule from the atmosphere progressively gets reduced by addition of a pair of hydrogen atoms. Triple bond between two nitrogen atoms (N≡N) are cleaved to produce ammonia (Figure 12.7).

Nitrogen fixation process requires Nitrogenase enzyme complex, Minerals (Mo, Fe and S), anaerobic condition, ATP, electron and glucose 6 phosphate as H1 donor. Nitrogenase enzyme is active only in anaerobic condition. To create this anaerobic condition a pigment known as **leghaemoglobin** is synthesized in the nodules which acts as oxygen scavenger and removes the oxygen. Nitrogen fixing bacteria in root nodules appears pinkish due to the presence of this leghaemoglobin pigment.
Overall equation:

N2 1 8e2 1 8H1 1 16ATP 2NH 1 1 H 1 16ADP 1 16 Pi

![Alt text](image-4.png)

**2\. Nitrification**
Ammonia (NH3) is converted into Nitrite (NO2) by _Nitrosomonas_ bacterium. Nitrite is then converted into Nitrate (NO3) by _Nitrobacter_ bacterium.
Plants are more adapted to absorb
nitrate (NO3) than ammonium ions from the soil.

**3\. Nitrate Assimilation**
The process by which nitrate is reduced to ammonia is called **nitrate assimilation** and occurs during nitrogen cycle.

**4\. Ammonification** Decomposition of organic nitrogen (proteins and amino acids) from dead plants and animals into ammonia is called **ammonification**. Organisim involved in this process are _Bacillus ramosus_ and _Bacillus vulgaris_.

**5\. Denitrification** Nitrates in the soil are converted back into atmospheric nitrogen by a process called **denitrification**. Bacteria involved in this process are Pseudomonas,Thiobacillus and Bacillus subtilis.

![Alt text](image-5.png)

The overall process of nitrogen cycle is given in Figure 12.8.

### Nitrogen Metabolism Ammonium Assimilation (Fate of Ammonia)

Ammonia is converted into amino acids by the following processes:

## Special modes of nutrition

Nutrition is the process of uptake and utilization of nutrients by living organisms. There are two main types such as **autotrophic** and **heterotrophic** nutrition. Autotrophic nutrition is further divided into **photosynthetic** and **chemosynthetic** nutrition. Heterotrophic nutrition is further divided into saprophytic, parasitic, symbiotic and insectivorous type. In this topic you are going to learn about special mode of nutrition.

### Saprophytic mode of nutrition in angiosperms

Saprophytes derive nutrients from dead and decaying matter. Bacteria and fungus are main saprophytic organisms. Some angiosperms also follow saprophytic mode of nutrition. Example: _Neottia_. Roots of _Neottia_ (Bird’s Nest Orchid) associate with mycorrhizae and absorb nutrients as a saprophyte. _Monotropa_ (Indian Pipe) grow on humus rich soil found in thick forests. It absorbs nutrient through mycorrhizal association (Figure 12.9).

![Alt text](image-6.png)

### Parasitic mode of nutrition in angiosperms

Organisms deriving their nutrient from another organism (host) and causing disease to the host are called parasites.
**a.** **Obligate or Total parasite** - Completely depends on host for their survival and produces haustoria.

i. **Total stem parasite**: The leafless stem twine around the host and produce haustoria. Example: _Cuscuta_ (Dodder), a rootless plant growing on _Zizyphus_, _Citrus_ and so on.

ii. **Total root parasite**: They do not have stem axis and grow in the roots of host plants produce haustoria. Example: _Rafflesia_, _Orobanche_ and _Balanophora_.

**b. Partial parasite** - Plants of this group contain chlorophyll and synthesize carbohydrates. Water and mineral requirements are dependent on host plant.
i. **Partial Stem Parasite**:
Example:Loranthus and Viscum (Mistletoe) Loranthus grows on fig and mango trees and absorb water and minerals from xylem.

ii. **Partial root parasite**: Example: _Santalum album_ (Sandal wood tree) in its juvenile stage produces haustoria which grows on roots of many plants (Figure 12.10).

![ Symbiotic mode of nutrition](12.11.png)

### Symbiotic mode of Nutrition

a. **Lichens**: It is a mutual association of

Algae and Fungi. Algae prepares food and fungi absorbs water and provides thallus structure.

b. **Mycorrhizae**: Fungi associated with roots of higher plants including Gymnosperms. Example: _Pinus_.

c. **_Rhizobium_ and Legumes**: This symbiotic association fixes atmospheric nitrogen

d. **Cyanobacteria and Coralloid Roots**: This association is found in _Cycas_ where _Nostoc_ associates with its coralloid roots. (Figure 12.11).

![Alt text](image-9.png)

### Insectivorous mode of nutrition

Plants which are growing in nitrogen deficient areas develop insectivorous habit to resolve nitrogen deficiency. These plants obtain nitrogen from the insects
a. **_Nepenthes_** (Pitcher plant): Pitcher is a modified leaf and contains digestive enzymes. Rim of the pitcher is provided with nectar glands and acts as an attractivelid. When insect is trapped, proteolytic enzymes will digest the insect.

b. **_Drosera_** (Sundew): It consists of long club shaped leaves with tentacles that secrete sticky digestive fluid which looks like a sundew and attracts insects.

c. **_Utricularia_** (Bladder wort): Submerged plant in which leaf is modified into a bladder to collect insect in water.

d. **_Dionaea_** (Venus fly trap): Leaf of this plant modified into a colourful trap. Two folds of lamina consist of sensitive trigger hairs and when insects touch the hairs it will close and traps the insects.(Figure 12.12).
