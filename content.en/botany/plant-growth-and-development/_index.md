The Banyan tree continues to grow for thousands of years and some others particularly annual plants cease growth within a season or within a year. Can you understand the reasons? How does a zygote give rise to an embryo and an embryo to a seedling? How does a new plant structure arise from the pre-existing structure? Growth is defined as an irreversible permanent increase in size, shape, number,volume and dry weight. Plant growth occurs by cell division, cell enlargement, differentiation and maturation.

Growth is measurable, it is amazing to know that one single maize root apical meristem can give rise to

more than 17,500 new cells per hour and cells in a watermelon may increase in size upto 3,50,000 times.

**th and Development**

## Characteristics of Growth
 - Growth increases in protoplasm at cellular

level. 
- Stem and roots are indeterminate in

growth due to continuous cell division and is called **open form of growth**.

- The primary growth of the plant is due to the activity of apical meristem where, new cells are added to root and shoot apex causing linear growth of plant body.

- The secondary vascular cambium and cork cambium add new cells to cause increase in girth.

- Leaves, flowers and fruits are limited in growth or determinate or **closed form growth.**

- Monocarpic annual plants produce flowers only once during lifetime and dies. Example: Paddy and Bean

Bamboos are evergreen grasses and certain species of it can grow at the rate of growth 91 cm per day. The Saguaro Cactus is a tree like cactus and is a slow growing

plant. The rate of growth is one inch in the first ten years and it does not begin to flower until it is about 60 years old. It’s lifespan exceeds 150 years and takes 75–100 years to grow a side arm.

**: Plant Physiology onal Organisation)**




  

- Monocarpic perennials produce flowers only once during life time but the plants survive for many years. Example: Bamboo.

- Polycarpic perennials produce flowers every year during life time. Example: Coconut.

### Kinetics of growth
 It is an analysis of the motion of cells or expansion. **1\. Stages in Growth rate** The total period from initial to the final stage of growth is called the **grand period of growth.** The total growth is plotted against time and ‘S’ shaped sigmoid curve (Grand period curve) is obtained. It consists of four phases. They are:

i. Lag phase ii. Log phase iii. Decelerating phase iv. Maturation phase

**i. Lag phase** In this phase new cells are formed from pre-existing cells slowly. It is found in the tip of the stem, root and branches. It is the initial stage of growth. In other words, growth starts from this period. **ii. Log phase or exponential growth** Here, the newly formed cell increases in size rapidly by deposition of cell wall material. Growth rate is maximum and reaches top because of cell division and physiological processes are quite fast. The volume of protoplasm also increases. It results in rapid growth and causes elongation of internode in the stem. **iii. Decelerating phase or Decline phase or**

**slow growth phase** The rate of growth decreases and becomes limited owing to internal and external or both the factors because the metabolic process becomes slow.

**iv. Steady state period or maturation phase** In this phase cell wall thickening due to new particle deposition on the inner surface of the cell wall takes place. The overall growth ceases and becomes constant. The growth rate becomes zero.  

**2\. Types of growth rate** The increased growth per unit time is termed as growth rate. An organism or part of an organism can produce more cells through arithmetic growth or geometric growth or both.

**i. Arithmetic Growth Rate** If the length of a plant organ is plotted against time, it shows a linear curve and this growth is called **arithmetic growth**.

- The rate of growth is constant and it increases in an arithmetic manner.

- Only one cell is allowed to divide between the two-resulting progeny cell.

- One continues to divide but the other undergoes cell cycle arrest and begins to develop, differentiate and mature.

- After each round of cell division, only a single cell remains capable of division and one new body cell forms.

For example, starting with a single cell after round 1 of cell division there is one dividing cell and one body cell. After round 2 there are two body cells, after round 3 there are three and so on (Figure 15.1).

Dividing cell

![ Arithmetic Growth Rate The plants single dividing cell would](15.1.png "")


undergo one million rounds of nuclear and










  

cellular division. If each round requires one day, this type of arithmetic increase would require one million days or 2739.7 years. This arithmetic rate is capable of producing small number of cells present in very small parts of plants. For example the hair on many leaves and stems consists of just a single row of cells produced by the division of the basal cell, the cell at the bottom of the hair next to other epidermal cells. Hair may contain 5 to 10 cells by the division of the basal cell. So, all its cells could be produced in just five to ten days. In the figure 15.2, on plotting the hight of the plant against time a linear curve is obtained. Mathematically it is expressed as:

Time

t o f t

he p

lan t

![ Constant Linear Growth Lt = Lo + rt _Lt_ = length at time ‘t’ _Lo_ = length at time zero _r_ = growth rate of elongation per unit](15.2.png "")


**ii. Geometric growth rate:** This growth occurs in many higher plants and plant organs and is measured in size or weight. In plant growth, geometric cell division results if all cells of an organism or tissue are active mitotically. Example: Round three in the given figure 15.3, produces 8 cells as 23 = 8 and after round 20 there are 220

\= 1,048,576 cells.  

The large plant or animal parts are produced this way. In fact, it is common in animals but rare in plants except when they are young and small. Exponential growth curve can be expressed as,

Mother cell

2 Progeny cells

8 Progeny cells

4 Progeny cells

![ Geometric growth **_W_1** = **_W_0_ert_**](15.3.png "")


**_W1_** = Final size (weight, height and number)

**_W0_** = Initial size at the beginning of the period

**_r_** = Growth rate **_t_** = Time of growth **_e_** = Base of the natural logarithms

Here ‘_r’_ is the relative growth rate and also a measure of the ability of the plant to produce new plant material, referred to as efficiency index. Hence, the final size of W1 depends on the initial size _W0_.

**iii. Arithmetic and Geometric Growth of Embryo** Plants often grow by a combination

of arithmetic and geometric growth patterns. A young embryonic plant grows geometrically and cell division becomes restricted to certain cells at the tips of roots and shoots. After this point, growth is of the slower arithmetic type, but some of the new cells that are produced can develop into their mature condition and begin carrying

| `a |

  

out specialized types of metabolism (Figure 15.4). Plants are thus a mixture of older, mature cells and young, dividing cells.

![ Arithmetic and geometric growth of embryo](15.4.png "")


Quantitative comparisons between the growth of living system can also be made in two ways and is explained in the table 1.

In figure 15.5, two leaves A and B are drawn at a particular time. Then A1and B1 are drawn after a given time. A and B = Area of leaves at a particular time. A1

and B1 = Area of leaves after a given time. (A1-A) and (B1-B) represents an absolute increase in area in the given time. Leaf A increases from 5 cm2 to 10 cm2; 5 cm2 in a given time. Leaf B increases from 50 cm2 to 55 cm2 ; 5 cm2 in a given time. Hence, both leaves A and B increase their area by 5 cm2 in a given time. This is absolute growth. Relative growth is faster in leaf A because of initial small size. It decreases with time.  

![ Diagrammatic comparision of absolute and relative growth rates](15.5.png "")


**Measurement of Growth Experiment: 1. Arc auxanometer:** The increase in the length of the stem tip can easily be measured by an arc auxanometer which consists of a small pulley to the axis of which is attached a long pointer sliding over a graduated arc. A thread one end of which is tied to the stem tip and another end to a weight passes over the pulley tightly. As soon as the stem tip increases in length, the pulley moves and the pointer slide over the graduated arc (Figure 15.6). The reading is taken. The actual increase in the length of the stem is then calculated by knowing the length of the pointer and the radius of the pulley. If the distance travelled by the pointer is 10 and the radius of the pulley is 4 inches and the length of the pint is 20 inches, the actual grown is measured as follows: Actual growth in length = (Distance travelled by the pointer × radius of the pulley) / Length of the pointer. For example, actual growth in length **=** (10 × 4 inches)/ 20 inches = 2 inches

## Plant Growth Regulators
 Plant Growth Regulators (chemical messenger) are defined as organic substances which are synthesized in minute quantities in one part of the plant body and transported to another part where they influence specific physiological processes. Five major groups of hormones _viz._, auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene and abscisic acid are presently known to coordinate and regulate growth and development in plants. The term phytohormones is implied to those chemical substances which are synthesized by plants and thus, naturally occurring. On the other hand, there are several manufactured chemicals which often resemble the hormones in physiological action and even in molecular structure. Recently, another two groups, the brassinosteroids and polyamines were also known to behave like hormones. **1\. Plant growth regulators – classification** Plant Growth Regulators are classified as natural and synthetic based on their source and a detailed flow diagram is given in Figure 15.7.

**Figure 15.7: Classification of Plant Growth** Regulators

**2\. Characteristics of phytohormones** i. Usually produced in tips of roots, stems

and leaves. ii. Transfer of hormones from one place to

another takes part through conductive systems.

iii. They are required in trace quantities. iv. All hormones are organic in nature. v. There are no specialized cells or organs for

their secretion.  

vi. They are capable of influencing physiological activities leading to promotion, inhibition and modification of growth.

**3\. Synergistic and Antagonistic effects** i. Synergistic effects: The effect of one or

more substance in such a way that both promote each others activity. Example: Activity of auxin and gibberellins or cytokinins.

ii. Antagonistic effects: The effect of two substances in such a way that they have opposite effects on the same process. One accelerates and other inhibits. Example: ABA and gibberellins during seed or bud dormancy. ABA induces dormancy and gibberellins break it.

### Auxins 1. Discovery
 During 1880, **Charles Darwin** noted the unilateral growth and curvature of Canary grass (_Phalaris canariensis_) coleoptile to light. The term auxin (Greek: Auxin – to Grow) was first used by F. W. Went in 1926 using Oats (_Avena_) coleoptile and isolated the auxin. F. W. Went in 1928 collected auxin in agar jelly. **Kogl** and **Haugen Smith** (1931) isolated Auxin from human urine, and called it as **Auxin A**. Later on in 1934, similar active substances was isolated from corn grain oil and was named as **Auxin B**. Kogl _et al.,_ (1934) found heteroauxin in the plant and chemically called it as **Indole Acetic Acid** (IAA) **2\. Occurrence** Auxin is generally produced by the growing tips of the stem and root, from where they migrate to the region of the action. **3\. Types of Auxin** Auxins are divided into two categories Natural auxins and Synthetic auxins.

**Anti-auxins** Anti-auxin compounds when applied to the plant inhibit the effect of auxin. Example: 2, 4, 5-Tri Iodine Benzoic Acid (TIBA) and Napthylpthalamine.

**(i) Free auxin** They move out of tissues as they are easily diffusible. Example: IAA. **(ii) Bound Auxin** They are not diffusible. Example: IAA. **4\. Precursor** The amino acid Tryptophan is the precursor of IAA and zinc is required for its synthesis. **5\. Chemical structure** Auxin has similar chemical structure of IAA. **6\. Transport in Plants** Auxin is polar in transport. It includes basipetal and acropetal transport. Basipetal means transport through phloem from shoot to root and acropetal means transport through xylem from root to shoot. **7\. Bioassay (Avena Curvature Test /**

**Went Experiment)** Bioassay means testing of substances for their activity in causing a growth response in a living plant or its part. **The procedure involves the following steps:** When the _Avena_ seedlings have attained a height of 15 to 30 mm, about 1mm of the coleoptile tip is removed. This apical part is the source of natural auxin. The tip is now placed on agar blocks for few hours. During this period, the auxin diffuses out of these tips into the agar. The auxin containing agar block is now placed on one side of the decapitated stump of Avena coleoptile. The auxin from the agar blocks diffuses down through coleoptile along the side to which the auxin agar block is placed. An agar block without auxin is placed on another decapitated coleoptile. Within an hour, the coleoptiles with auxin agar block bends on the opposite side where the agar block is placed.

**Types of Auxin**

**Natural Synthe** Auxin occuring in plants are called “Natural auxin”

1\. Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) 2. Indole Propionic Acid (IPA) 3. Indole Butyric Acid (IBA) 4. Phenyl Acetic Acid (PAA)

These are synthesized artific properties like Auxin.

1\. 2,4-Dichloro Phenoxy Acet 2. 2,4,5-Trichloro Phenoxy Ac 3. Napthalene Acetic Acid (NA  

This curvature can be measured (Figure 15.8). **8\. Physiological Effects*. 
- They promote cell elongation in

stem and coleoptile. 
- At higher concentrations

auxins inhibit the elongation of roots but extermely lower concentrations promotes growth of root.

- Suppression of growth in lateral bud by apical bud due to auxin produced by apical bud is termed as **apical dominance**.

- Auxin prevents abscission. 
- It is used to eradicate weeds. Example: 2,4-D

and 2,4,5-T. 
- Synthetic auxins are used in the formation of

seedless fruits (Parthenocarpic fruit). 
- It is used to break the dormancy in seeds.

### Gibberellins 1. Discovery
 The effect of gibberellins had been known in Japan since early 1800 where certain rice plants were found to suffer from ‘Bakanae’ or foolish seedling disease. This disease was found by **Kurosawa** (1926) to be caused by a fungus _Gibberella fujikuroi. The active substance_ was separated from fungus and named as

**tic** ially and have

ic Acid (2,4-D) etic Acid (2,4,5-T) A)




  

gibberellin by Yabuta (1935). These are more than 100 gibberellins reported from both fungi and higher plants. They are noted as GA1, GA2, GA3 and so on. GA3 is the first discovered gibberellin. In 1938, **Yabuta** and **Sumiki** isolated gibberellin in crystalline form. In1955, **Brain** _et al.,_ gave the name **gibberellic acid**. In 1961, Cross _et al.,_ established its structure.

**Agent Orange** Mixture of two phenoxy herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T is given the name ‘Agent orange’ which was used by USA in Vietnam war for defoliation of forest (chemical warfare).

In botanical gardens and tea gardens, gardeners trim the plants regularly so that they remain bushy. Does this practice have any scientific explanation?

Yes, trimming of plants removes apical buds and hence apical dominance. The lateral buds sprout and make the plants bushy.

**2\. Occurrence** The major site of gibberellin production in plants is parts like embryo, roots and young leaves near the tip. Immature seeds are rich in gibberellins. **3\. Precursors** The gibberellins are chemically related to terpenoids (natural rubber, carotenoids and steroids) formed by 5-C precursor, an Isoprenoid unit called Iso Pentenyl Pyrophosphate (IPP) through a number of intermediates. The primary precursor is acetate. **4\. Chemical structure** All gibberellins have gibbane ring structure. **5\. Transport in plants** The transport of gibberellins in plants is non- polar. Gibberellins are translocated through  

phloem and also occur in xylem due to lateral movement between vascular bundles. **6\. Bioassay (Dwarf Pea assay)** Seeds of dwarf pea are allowed to germinate till the formation of the coleoptile. GA solution is applied to some seedlings. Others are kept under control. Epicotyl length is measured and as such, GA stimulating epicotyl growth can be seen. **7\. Physiological Effects*. 
- It produces extraordinary elongation of stem

caused by cell division and cell elongation. 
- Rosette plants (genetic dwarfism) exhibit

excessive internodal growth when they are treated with gibberellins. This sudden elongation of stem followed by flowering by the application of gibberellin is called bolting (Figure 15.9).

- Gibberellin breaks dormancy in potato tubers.

- Many biennials usually flower during second year of their growth. For flowering in the first year it self these plants should be treated with gibberellins.

- Formation of seedless fruits without fertili- zation is induced by gibberellins Example: Seedless tomato, apple and cucumber.

- Promotes elongation of inter-node in sugarcane without decreasing sugar content.

- Promotion of flowering in long day plants even under short day conditions.

- It stimulates the seed germination.

### Cytokinins (Cytos – cell, Kinesis – division) 1. Discovery
 The presence of cell division inducing substances in plants was first demonstrated by **Haberlandt** in 1913 in Coconut milk (liquid




  

endosperm of coconut) which contains cell division inducing substances. In 1954, Skoog and Miller discovered that autoclaved DNA from herring sperm stimulated cell division in tobacco pith cells. They called this cell division inducing principle as kinetin (chemical structure: 6-Furfuryl Amino Acid). This does not occur in plants. In 1963, Letham introduced the term cytokinin. In 1964, Letham and Miller isolated and identified a new cytokinin called Zeatin from unripe grains of maize. The most widely occurring cytokinin in plants is Iso Pentenyl adenine (IPA). **2\. Occurrence** Cytokinin is formed in root apex, shoot apex, buds and young fruits. **3\. Precursor** Cytokinins are derivatives of the purine adenine. **4\. Bioassay (Neem Cotyledon Assay)** Neem cotyledons are measured and placed in cytokinin solution as well as in ordinary water. Enlargement of cotyledons is an indication of cytokinin activity. **5\. Transport in plants** The distribution of cytokinin in plants is not as wide as those of auxin and gibberellins but found mostly in roots. Cytokinins appear to be translocated through xylem.

**6\. Physiological effect*. 
- Cytokinin promotes cell division in the

presence of auxin (IAA). 
- Cytokinin induces cell enlargement

associated with IAA and gibberellin. 
- Cytokinin can break the dormancy of

certain light-sensitive seeds like tobacco and induces seed germination.

- Cytokinin promotes the growth of lateral bud in the presence of apical bud.

- Application of cytokinin delays the process of aging by nutrient mobilization. It is known as Richmond Lang effect.

- Cytokinin (i) increases rate protein synthesis (ii) induces the formation of inter-fascicular cambium (iii) overcomes apical dominance (iv) induces formation of new leaves, chloroplast and lateral shoots.

- Plants accumulate solutes very actively with the help of cytokinins.

### Ethylene (Gaseous Phytohormone)
 Almost all plant tissues produce ethylene gas in minute quantities. **1\. Discovery** In 1924, **Denny** found that ethylene stimulates the ripening of lemons. In 1934, **R.** **Gane** found that ripe bananas contain abundant ethylene. In 1935, Cocken et al., identified ethylene as a natural plant hormone.

**2\. Occurrence** Maximum synthesis occurs during climacteric ripening of fruits (_see_ Box info) and tissues undergoing senescence. It is formed in almost all plant parts like roots, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. **3\. Transport in plants** Ethylene can easily diffuse inside the plant through intercellular spaces. **4\. Precursor** It is a derivative of amino acid methionine, linolenic acid and fumaric acid. **5\. Bioassay (Gas Chromatography)** Ethylene can be measured by gas chromatography. This technique helps in the detection of exact amount of ethylene from different plant tissues like lemon and orange. **6\. Physiological Effects*. 
- Ethylene stimulates respiration and ripening

in fruits. 
- It breaks the dormancy of buds, seeds and

storage organs. 
- It stimulates formation of abscission zone

in leaves, flowers and fruits. This makes the leaves to shed prematurely.

- Inhibition of stem elongation (shortening the internode).

- Growth of lateral roots and root hairs. This increases the absorption surface of the plant roots.

- Ethylene normally reduces flowering in plants except in Pine apple and Mango.

### Abscisic Acid (ABA) (Stress Phyto hormone)


**1\. Discovery** In 1963, the hormone was first isolated by **Addicott _et al.,_** from young cotton bolls and named as **Abscission II**. Eagles and Wareing during 1963–64 isolated a dormancy inducing substance from leaves of _Betula_ and called it as dormin. In 1965, it was found by Cornsforth _et al_., that both dormin and abscission are chemically same compounds and called **Abscisi**c **Acid (ABA)**. **2\. Occurrence** This hormone is found abundantly inside  

**3\. Precursors** The hormone is formed from mevalonic acid pathway or xanthophylls. **4\. Transport in plants** Abscisic acid is transported to all parts of the plant through diffusion as well as through phloem and xylem. **5\. Chemical structure** It has carotenoid structure. **6\. Bioassay (Rice Coleoptile)** The inhibition of IAA induces straight growth of rice seedling coleoptiles. **7\. Physiological effects*. 
- It helps in reducing transpiration rate by

closing stomata. 
- ABA is a powerful growth inhibitor. It

causes 50% inhibition of growth in Oat coleoptile.

- It induces bud and seed dormancy. 
- It promotes the abscission of leaves, flowers

and fruits by forming abscission layers. 
- ABA plays an important role in plants

during water stress and during drought conditions. It results in loss of turgor and closure of stomata.

- In Cannabis sativa, induces male flower formation on female plants.

- It promotes sprouting in storage organs like Potato.

- It inhibits the shoot growth and promotes growth of root system. This character protect the plants from water stress. Hence, ABA is called as **stress hormone.**

## Plant Movements
 Plants have the capacity for changing their positions in response to external or internal stimuli, which are known as **plant movements**. Movements are basically of two types: I. Vital movements and II. Physical movements (hygroscopic) (Figure 15.10). **I. Vital movements** Vital movements are those which are exhibited by the living cells or plants or




  

organs and they are always related to the irritability of the protoplasm. These movements are of two types:

A. Movements of locomotion B. Movements of curvature

**A. Movements of locomotion** These movements include the movement of protoplasm inside the cell or movement of whole unicellular or multicellular plant body as in _Chlamydomonas_, gametes and zoospores. **i. Autonomic movements of locomotion** The movements arising from internal changes or internal stimuli of plant body is called **autonomic movements** of locomotion. This movement takes place due to the presence of cilia or flagella and movement of cytoplasm (Cyclosis).

**ii. Paratonic or Tactic (induced) movements of locomotion** The movements due to external factors or stimuli like light, temperature and chemicals are called paratonic movement of locomotion (Figure 15.11). **B. Movement of curvature** In higher plants they are restricted only to bending or curvature of some of their parts. There are mainly two types:

They are i) Autonomic movement of curvature and ii) Paratonic movement of curvature. **i. Autonomic movements of curvature** The movement arising from internal changes or internal stimuli of plant body is called **autonomic movement of curvature. This** does not require any external stimulus. They are two types: a. **Autonomic movement of growth:** It is of

the following types:

Hyponasty Epinasty

![Hyponasty and Epinasty 1. Hyponasty**: When growth is more on lower surface, petals show curvature on upper side and ultimately the flower becomes closed. Such type of movement is called **hyponasty_._ 2\. Epinasty**: When the growth is more on upper surface, petals show curvature on the lower side and ultimately the flower opens. Such movement is called **epinasty. The flower usually opens at](15.12.png "")

3\. Nutation: The growth of the stem apices occurs in a zig-zag manner. It is because the two sides of the stem apex alternatively grow more. Such growth movements are called as nutational movements. In some plants nutational movements allow the shoots apex to grow in helical path in upward direction. This movement is called circumnutation. It is commonly found in the stems of climbers of _Cucurbitaceae_ (Figure 15.13).

![ Circumnutation b. **Autonomic Movement of variation:**](15.13.png "")


It happens in Indian telegraph plant. (_Desmodium gyrans_). The com pound leaf consists of a larger terminal and two smaller lateral leaflets. During day time, the two lateral leaflets move upward at an angle of 90° and come to lie parallel to the rachis. Again, they may move downward at 180° so that they are parallel to the rachis. They may again move upward at 90° to come in their original position. All these movements occur with jerks after intervals, each movement being completed in about 2 minutes (Figure 15.14).

**ii. Paratonic (induces) movements of curvature**

The movement arising from external stimulus is called **Paratonic** (Induced) movements of curvature. They are of two types. 1) Tropic movements 2) Nastic movements (Table 2)

**Table 2: Differences between Tropic M Tropic Movements**

1\. Movement occurs due to unidirectional stimulus. 2. The stimulus acts on protoplasm from one

direction only. 3. The response is directly related to the direction of

the stimulus. 4. These are movements of curvature caused

by unilateral growth. 5. Tropic movements may be phototropic, geotropic,

hydrotropic, thigmotropic, chemotropic, thermotropic or aerotropic.  

![No Desc](15.14.png "")
 Autonomic Movement of Variation

**a. Tropic movements** A movement that occurs in response to an unidirectional stimulus is called **tropic movement or tropism. There are seven types** in tropic movements (Geotropic, Phototropic, Thigmotropic, Chemotropic, Hydrotropic, Thermotropic and Aerotropic) **1\. Geotropism** The movements which take place in response to gravity stimulus are called **geotropic movements. The primary roots growing** down into soil are **positive geotropic.** Primary stems that grow away from soil (against gravity) are **negative geotropic**. Secondary roots growing at right angles to the force of gravity are **Diageotropic**. Secondary lateral roots which grow obliquely downwards are **Plagiogeotropic**. Lateral roots and branches which are not sensitive to gravitational stimulus are **Apogeotropic**. **2\. Phototropism** The tropic movement taking place as a response to light stimulus is called **phototropism**. Some of the plant parts such as stems, branches, leaves and pedicels of flowers move towards the stimulus of light and are said to be **positively phototropic** **ovements and Nastic movements**

**Nastic movements** These movements occur due to a diffused stimulus. The stimulus acts on the protoplasm from all sides.

The response has no relation to the direction of the stimulus but with organ. These are also the movement of curvature but they are caused by reversible turgor changes. Nastic movements may be seismonastic, photonastic or thermonastic

while others such as roots and rhizoids which move away from the stimulus of light are called **negatively phototropic**. **b. Nastic Movements** When growth movements occur in response to an external stimulus which is not unidirectional but diffused, they are called nastic or paratonic movements of variation. Paratonic variation movements are determined by some external stimuli, light, temperature, chemicals and touch. They are: **1\. Nyctinastic movement (or) sleep**

**movement** The diurnal (change in day-night) movements of leaves and flowers of some species which take up sleep position at night are called **nyctinastic movements. They are caused by relative changes** in cell size on the opposite sides of the leaf base called pulvinus. The movements are attributed to the amount of auxin and K1 ions. The entry of water to the lower side of the pulvinus causes the leaves to stand erect and exit of water causes them to drop. They are of two types: **i. Photonasty** The nastic movement caused in response to light is called **photonasty** or **photonastic**

**Experiment to demonstrate negative geotropism in aerial stem** The Clinostat has a rotating pot like container mounted on an axis rod. A potted plant is fitted horizontally on the Clinostat and rotated slowly which completely eliminates gravity as all the sides of the plant are equally stimulated. If the rotation of the Clinostat is stopped for a considerable period of time then the tip of the stem is observed to curve and grow upwards this proves that the stem tip is negatively geotropic (Figure 15.15).

Clinostat

**movement. The opening of leaves and flowers** during daytime and their close at night is an example. **ii. Thermonasty** The nastic movement taking place in response to temperature is called **thermonasty** or **thermonastic movement**. In _Crocus_ the flowers open at high temperature and close at low temperature. **2\. Seismonastic movement** This means a response to shaking. The best example is _Mimosa pudica_ (Touch-me-not plant) which is a sensitive plant (Figure 15.17). Such plants respond to stimuli such as touch, blow or metallic shock by folding their leaflets and lowering their leaves .This effect is caused by the movement of water in

**Experiment to demonstrate positive phototropism in shoot tips** A darkened black box is taken having a small window on one side. A well-watered potted plant is placed inside the box. This is referred to as a phototropic chamber or heliotropic chamber. If the window is kept closed for about 24 hours the plant shows normal growth. If the window is kept opened, it is found after two days that the shoot tip bends and grows towards light proving that it is positively phototropic (Figure 15.16).

**3\. Thigmonastic movement** The movements found in the leaves of _Drosera and Dionaea (Venus fly trap) result_ in response to the touch stimulus of insects. As soon as an insect sits on the leaf the cilia curve inward to trap the insect and trigger hairs are activated. Similarly, in dionaea, the two halves of the leaf curve upwards along the midrib. These parts of the leaves come  

to their normal position after the insect has been digested (Figure 15.19).

**Figure 15.19: Thigmonasty in Dionaea**

**II Physical Movement (Hygroscopic Movements)**

Physical movements are those which are found in dead parts of the plants and they are not related to any irritability of the protoplasm. They are also called hygroscopic **movements** or **mechanical movements**. Dispersal of spores and seeds, dehiscence of sporangia, bursting of seeds and movement of elaters are the examples of physical or hygroscopic movement.

## Photoperiodism
 Trees take several years for initiation of flowering whereas an annual herb flowers within few months. Each plant requires a specific time period to complete their vegetative phase which will be followed by reproductive phase as per their internal control points through Biological Clock. The physiological mechanisms in relation to flowering are controlled by (i) light period (Photoperiodism) and (ii) temperature (Vernalization). The physiological change on flowering due to relative length of light and darkness (photoperiod) is called Photoperiodism. The term photoperiodism was coined by **Garner** and **Allard** (1920) when they observed this in ‘Biloxi’ variety of soybean (_Glycine max_) and ‘Maryland mammoth’ variety of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The photoperiod required to induce flowering is called critical **day length**. Maryland mammoth (tobacco variety) requires 12 hours of light and cocklebur (_Xanthium pensylvanicum_) requires 15.05 hours of light for flowering.




  

**1\. Classification of plants based on Photoperiodism**

i. Long day plants: The plants that require long critical day length for flowering are called long day plants or short night plants. Example: Pea, Barley and Oats.

ii. Short day plants: The plants that require a short critical day length for flowering are called short day plants or long night plants. Example: Tobacco, Cocklebur, Soybean, Rice and _Chrysanthemum_.

iii. Day neutral plants: There are a number of plants which can flower in all possible photoperiods. They are also called photo **neutrals** or **indeterminate plants**. Example: Potato, _Rhododendron_, Tomato and Cotton.

**2\. Photoperiodic induction** An appropriate photoperiod in 24 hours’ cycle constitutes one inductive cycle. Plants may require one or more inductive cycles for flowering. The phenomenon of conversion of leaf primordia into flower primordia under the influence of suitable inductive cycles is called **photoperiodic induction**. Example: _Xanthium_ (SDP) – 1 inductive cycle and _Plantago_ (LDP) – 25 inductive cycles. **3\. Site of Photoinductive perception**

![ Experiment on Cocklebur plant showing photoperiodic stimulus](15.20.png "")


Photoperiodic stimulus is perceived by the leaves. Floral hormone is synthesised in leaves and translocated to the apical tip to promote flowering. This can be explained by a simple experiment on Cocklebur (_Xanthium pensylvanicum_), a short day plant.  

Usually Xanthium will flower under short day conditions. If the plant is defoliated and kept under short day conditions it will not flower. Flowering will occur even when all the leaves are removed except one leaf. If a cocklebur plant is defoliated and kept under long day conditions, it will not flower. If one of its leaves is exposed to short day condition and rest are in long day condition, flowering will occur (Figure 15.20). **4\. Importance of photoperiodism** 1\. The knowledge of photoperiodism

plays an important role in hybridisation experiments.

2\. Photoperiodism is an excellent example of physiological pre-conditioning that is using an external factor to induce physiological changes in the plant.

Phytochrome is a bluish biliprotein pigment responsible for the perception of light in photo physiological process. **Butler** **_et al.,_** (1959) named this pigment and it exists in two interconvertible forms: (i) red light absorbing pigment which is designated as Pr and (ii) far red light absorbing pigment which is designated as Pfr. The Pr form absorbs red light in 660nm and changes to Pfr. The Pfr form absorbs far red light in 730nm and changes to Pr. The Pr form is biologically inactive and it is stable whereas Pfr form is biologically active and it is very unstable. In short day plants, Pr promotes flowering and Pfr inhibits the flowering whereas in long day plants flowering is promoted by Pfr and inhibited by Pr form. Pfr is always associated with hydrophobic area of membrane systems while Pr is found in diffused state in the cytoplasm. The interconversion of the two forms of phytochrome is mainly involved in flower induction and also additionally plays




  

a role in seed germination and changes in membrane conformation.

## Vernalization (_Vernal_ – Spring Like)
 Besides photoperiod certain plants require a low temperature exposure in their earlier stages for flowering. Many species of biennials and perennials are induced to flower by low temperature exposure (0oC to 5oC). This process is called Vernalization. The term Vernalization was first used by T. **D. Lysenko** (1938).

**1\. Mechanism of Vernalization:** Two main theories to explain the mechanism of vernalization are:

i. Hypothesis of phasic development ii. Hypothesis of hormonal involvement

**i. Hypothesis of phasic development** According to Lysenko, development of an annual seed plant consists of two phases. First  

phase is **thermostage**, which is vegetative phase requiring low temperature and suitable moisture. Next phase is **photo stage** which requires high temperature for synthesis of florigen (flowering hormone).

**ii. Hypothesis of hormonal involvement** According to **Purvis** (1961), formation of a substance A from its precursor, is converted into B after chilling. The substance B is unstable. At suitable temperature B is converted into stable compound D called **Vernalin**. Vernalin is converted to F (Florigen). Florigen induces flower formation. At high temperature B is converted to C and devernalization occurs (Figure 15.21).

**2\. Technique of Vernalization:** The seeds are first soaked in water and allowed to germinate at 10o C to 12o C. Then seeds are transferred to low temperature (3oC to 5oC) from few days to 30 days. Germinated seeds




  

after this treatment are allowed to dry and then sown. The plants will show quick flowering when compared to untreated control plants.

and induces the plant to flower earlier. 2. It increases the cold resistance of the plants. 3. It increases the resistance of plants to fungal

disease. 4. Plant breeding can be accelerated.

## Seed Germination and Dormancy I. Seed Germination
 The activation and growth of embryo from seed into seedling during favourable conditions is called **seed** **germination**. **1\. Types of germination** There are two methods of seed germination. Epigeal and hypogeal. **i. Epigeal germination** During epigeal germination cotyledons are pushed out of the soil. This happens due to the elongation of the hypocotyl. Example: Castor and Bean. **ii. Hypogeal germination** During hypogeal germination cotyledons remain below the soil due to rapid elongation of epicotyls (Figure 15.22). Example: Maize, Pea. **2\. Factors affecting germination** Seed germination is directly affected by external and internal factors:  

**i. External factors** a. **Water**: It activates the enzymes which

digest the complex reserve foods of the seed. If the water content of the seed goes below a critical level, seeds fail to germinate.

b. **Temperature**: Seeds fails to germinate at very low and high temperature. The optimum temperature is 25oC to 35oC for most tropic species.

c. **Oxygen**: It is necessary for germination. Since aerobic respiration is a physiological requirement for germination most will germinate well in air containing 20% oxygen.

d. Light: There are many seeds which respond to light for germination and these seeds said to be photoblastic.

e. **Soil conditions**: Germination of seed in its natural habit is influenced by soil conditions such as water holding capacity, mineral composition and aeration of the soil.

**ii. Internal factors** a. Maturity of embryo: The seeds of some

plants, when shed will contain immature embryo. Such seeds germinate only after maturation of embryo.

b. **Viability**: Usually seeds remain viable or living only for a particular period. Viability

of seeds range from a few days (Example: _Oxalis_) to more than hundred years. Maximum viability (1000 years) has been recorded in lotus seeds. Seeds germinate only within the period of viability.

c. **Dormancy**: Seeds of many plants are dormant at the time of shedding. A detailed treatment is given below.

**II. Seed Dormancy** The seeds of most plants germinate under favourable environmental conditions but some seeds do not germinate when suitable conditions like water, oxygen and favourable temperature are not available. Germination of such seeds may be delayed for days, months or years. The condition of a seed when it fails to germinate even in suitable environmental condition is called seed dormancy. There are two main reasons for the development of dormancy: Imposed dormancy and innate dormancy. Imposed dormancy is due to low moisture and low temperature. Innate dormancy is related to the properties of seed itself. **1\. Factors causing dormancy of seeds:**

i. Hard, tough seed coat causes barrier effect as impermeability of water, gas and restriction of the expansion of embryo prevents seed germination.

ii. Many species of seeds produce imperfectly developed embryos called **rudimentary embryos** which promotes dormancy.

iii. Lack of specific light requirement leads to seed dormancy.

iv. A range of temperatures either higher or lower cause dormancy.

v. The presence of inhibitors like phenolic compounds which inhibits seed germination cause dormancy.

**2\. Methods of breaking dormancy:** The dormancy of seeds can be broken by different methods. These are: i. Scarification: Mechanical and chemical

treatments like cutting or chipping of hard tough seed coat and use of organic solvents to remove waxy or fatty compounds are called as Scarification.  

ii. **Impaction**: In some seeds water and oxygen are unable to penetrate micropyle due to blockage by cork cells. These seeds are shaken vigorously to remove the plug which is called **Impaction**.

iii. Stratification: Seeds of rosaceous plants (Apple, Plum, Peach and Cherry) will not germinate until they have been exposed to well aerated, moist condition under low temperature (0oC to 10oC) for weeks to months. Such treatment is called **Stratification.**

iv. **Alternating temperatures**: Germination of some seeds is strongly promoted by alternating daily temperatures. An alternation of low and high temperature improves the germination of seeds.

v. Light: The dormancy of photoblastic seeds can be broken by exposing them to red light.

## Senescence
 Plant life comprises some sequential events, _viz_: germination, juvenile stage, maturation, old age and death. Old age is called **senescence** in plants. Senescence refers to all collective, progressive and deteriorative processes which ultimately lead to complete loss of organization and function. Unlike animals, plants continuously form new organs and older organs undergo a highly regulated senescence program to maximize nutrient export.

The branch of botany which deals with ageing, abscission and senescence is called **Phytogerontology**

**1\. Types of Senescence Leopold** (1961) has recognised four types of senescence:

i. Overall senescence ii. Top senescence iii. Deciduous senescence iv. Progressive senescence i. Overall senescence: This kind of

senescence occurs in annual plants when entire plant gets affected and dies.




  

Example: Wheat and Soybean. It also occurs in few perennials also. Example: _Agave_ and Bamboo.

ii. **Top senescence**: It occurs in aerial parts of plants. It is common in perennials, underground and root system remains viable. Example: Banana and _Gladiolus_.

iii. **Deciduous senescence**: It is common in deciduous plants and occurs only in leaves of plants, bulk of the stem and root system remains alive. Example: Elm and Maple.

iv. Progressive senescence: This kind of senescence is gradual. First it occurs in old leaves followed by new leaves then stem and finally root system. It is common in annuals (Figure 15.23).

**Overall senescence**

**Top senescence**

**Deciduous senescence**

**Progressive senescence**

**Figure 15.23: Different types of** senescence in plants

**2\. Physiology of Senescence*. 
- Cells undergo changes in structure. 
- Vacuole of the cell acts as lysosome and

secretes hydrolytic enzymes. 
- The starch content is decreased in the cells. 
- Photosynthesis is reduced due to loss of

chlorophyll accompanied by synthesis and accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, therefore the leaf becomes red.

- There is a marked decrease in protein content in the senescing organ.

- RNA content of the leaf particularly rRNA level is decreased in the cells due to increased activity of the enzyme RNAase.

- DNA molecules in senescencing leaves degenerate by the increased activity of enzyme DNAase.

**3\. Factors affecting Senescence:*. 
- ABA and ethylene accelerate senescence

while auxin and cytokinin retard senescence.

**Mitochondria**

**Vacuole**

**Nucleus**

- Nitrogen deficiency increases senescence whereas nitrogen supply retards senescence.

- High temperature accelerates senescence but low temperature retards senescence.

- Senescence is rapid in dark than in light. 
- Water stress leads to accumulation of ABA

leading to senescence. **4\. Programmed cell death (PCD)**

![ Programmed cell death Senescence is controlled by plants own genetic programme and death of the plant or plant part consequent to senescence is called **Programmed Cell Death**. In short senescence of an individual cell is called **PCD**. The proteolytic enzymes involving PCD in plants are **phytaspases** and in animals are **caspases. The nutrients and other substrates** from senescing cells and tissues are remobilized and reallocated to other parts of the plant that survives. The protoplasts of developing xylem vessels and tracheids die and disappear at maturity to make them functionally efficient to conduct water for transport. In aquatic plants, aerenchyma is normally formed in different parts of the plant such as roots and stems which encloses large air spaces that are created through PCD. In the development of unisexual flowers, male and female flowers are present in earlier stages, but only one of these two completes its development while other aborts through PCD (Figure 15.24).](15.24.png "")





  

**5\. Abscission** Abscission is a physiological process of shedding of organs like leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds from the parent plant body. When these parts are removed the plant seals off its vascular system to prevent loss of water and nutrients. Final stage of senescence is abscission. In temperate regions all the leaves of deciduous plants fall in autumn and give rise to naked appearance, then the new leaves are developed in the subsequent spring season. But in evergreen plants there is gradual abscission of leaves, the older leaves fall while new leaves are developed continuously throughout the year.

**6\. Morphological and Anatomical changes during abscission** Leaf abscission takes place at the base of petiole which is marked internally by a distinct zone of few layers of thin walled cells arranged transversely. This zone is called **abscission zone or abscission layer**. An abscission layer is greenish-grey in colour and is formed by rows of cells of 2 to 15 cells thick. The cells of abscission layer separate due to dissolution of middle lamella and primary wall of cells by the activity of enzymes **pectinase** and **cellulase** resulting in loosening of cells. Tyloses are also formed blocking the conducting vessels. Degrading of chlorophyll occur leading to the change in the colour of leaves, leaf detachment from the plant and leaf fall. After abscission, outer layer of cells becomes suberized by the development of periderm (Figure 15.25). **7\. Hormones influencing abscission** All naturally occurring hormones influence the process of abscission. Auxins and cytokinins retard abscission, while abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene induce it.

**8\. Significance of abscission** 1\. Abscission separates dead parts

of the plant, like old leaves and ripe fruits. **Figur**

**Allelopathy**  

2\. It helps in dispersal of fruits and continuing the life cycle of the plant.

3\. Abscission of leaves in deciduous plants helps in water conservation during summer.

4\. In lower plants, shedding of vegetative parts like gemmae or plantlets help in vegetative reproduction.

## Stress Physiology
 Like all other organisms, plants are also subjected to various environmental stresses such as water deficit, drought, cold, heat, salinity and air pollution. The study of functioning of plants under adverse environmental conditions is called **stress physiology**. **Jacob Levitt (1972) first used the term biological stress** in relation to plants and according to him stress is “any change in environmental condition that might adversely change the growth and development of a plant”.

**e 15.26: Classification of Stress types in plants**

The reaction of plants facing stress is called **strain**. For example, if a normal plant growing under favourable light conditions is subjected to low light intensity, its photosynthesis is reduced. Thus, low light intensity is referred as stress and reduction of photosynthesis is referred as strain. Biological strains are of two types; Elastic biological strain and Plastic biological strain. If the reaction of plant function is temporary and when it returns to its original state it is called **elastic biological strain**. Example: Temporary wilting. If the reaction is permanent and the plant function does not return to the normal state it is called **plastic biological strain**. Example: Permanent wilting. Some plants get adapted to stress condition and are not adversely affected by stress. Such plants are called **stress resistant** or **stress tolerant** plants. Example: Mangroves. Some plants cannot face stress and they pass their adverse period in dormant state and so they are called **stress enduring plants**. Ephemeral plants are short lived desert plants, which complete their life cycle during the seasonal rains before the onset of dry season. These ephemeral plants are called **stress escapers**. Stress in plants can be classified as given in figure 15.26. **1\. Biotic Stresses** These are adverse effects on plants caused by other living organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, insects, weeds and competing plants. Biotic environmental stress is also caused due to the activity of man by cutting herbs and trees, twigs for fodders, fuels and agricultural purposes. The biotic stresses caused by bacteria, fungi and nematodes that are ever present in the environment are called potential biotic stresses. These are divided into two types. They are: **i) Allelopathy** An organism producing one or more biochemical substances that greatly influence the germination, growth and  

reproduction of other organisms is called Allelopathy. These biochemicals are known as allelochemicals. They are beneficial (positive allelopathic) or detrimental (negative allelopathic). These allelochemicals are obtained from leaf after leaching on the ground and also from roots. The term allelopathy is from Greek words _allelon-each other and pathos-to suffer_ and first used in 1937 by Hans Molisch. Allelopathic effect may occur with weeds on crops and _vice versa_ (Figure 15.27).

![ Allelopathy in plants](15.27.png "")

Retard growth

Promote growth

One of the most famous allelopathic plants is Black walnut (Juglans nigrum). The chemical which is present in Black walnut is Juglone and it is a respiratory inhibitor. Solanaceous plants such as tomato, capsicum and eggplant are susceptible to juglone. These plants when exposed to these allelochemicals exhibit symptoms such as wilting, chlorosis and death.

**Check your grasp!** Are all plants allelopathic? Can allelopathic chemicals affect animals and humans?

Tree of heaven (_Ailanthus altissima_) is a recent addition to the list of allelopathic trees. **Ailanthone** an allelochemical extracted from the root of _Ailanthus_ acts as potent herbicide. In _Sorghum_ plant the allelochemical sorgolone possess allelopathic activity. It is found in root exudates of most _Sorghum_ species. Root exudation of maize inhibits the growth of some weeds such as _Chenopodium album_ and _Amaranthus retroflexus. The seed exudates of_ oat (Avena fatua) affect the germination of wheat seedling.




  

**ii. Pathogenecity** The effect of microbes that cause diseases in plants. Example: _Xanthomonas citri_ **2\. Abiotic Stresses** Abiotic stress may occur due to an atmospheric condition (atmospheric stress) or soil condition (edaphic stress). Atmospheric stresses may occur due to excess and deficient levels of light, temperature and air pollutants. **i. Light Stress** Light limits the distribution of species. In low light intensity **Sciophytes** (shade loving plants) develop, while in high light intensity **Heliophytes** (high light loving plants) develop. In low light intensity, stomata do not fully open hence there is less diffusion of gases. As a result, there is less photosynthesis and the chlorophyll synthesis is also affected. High light intensity also inhibits photosynthesis. Change in photoperiod inhibits flowering. **ii. Temperature** Plants are adapted to a particular region and they face temperature stress in another region. **a. High temperature** High temperature causes soil and atmospheric drought. Plants are subjected to permanent wilting in soil drought and temporary wilting in atmospheric drought. Plants generally die above temperature of 44oC. However, some organisms like _Mastigocladus_ (a cyanobacterium) grow well at 85oC to 90oC in hot springs. At 42oC synthesis of normal protein declines and new protein called Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) appears. These proteins were discovered in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and since then they have also been discovered in animals, plants and microorganisms. At high temperature all physiological processes decline. Photosynthesis decreases and respiration increases. So, plants face a shortage of organic substances.  

Apple, a temperate plant, when planted in tropical condition fails to produce fruits and growth is also affected.

**b. Low Temperature** Low temperature stress is quite harmful to plants and the temperature near freezing point causes irreversible damage so that the plants fail to survive under extreme cold conditions. However, some plants growing in alpine and arctic regions can survive under low temperature and such plants are said to be **cold resistant**. Stress due to freezing temperature is called **frost stress**. Temperature below 10oC, decreases root growth, increases leakage of ions and ethylene production.

Some plant parts like Seeds, pollen grains and embryos can be stored at very low temperature (–196oC).

**iii. Air pollutants** Important atmospheric pollutants prevalent in the Indian sub-continent are CO2, CO, SO2, NO2, O3, fluoride and H2S. These pollutants do not cause visible injury but cause hidden injury. If the concentration of these pollutants increases visible injury like chlorotic and necrotic spots appear on leaves as well as inhibit photosynthetic carbon metabolism and biomass formation. Some pollutants at low concentration stimulate plant growth. Example: SO2, NO2

and NO. Respiration and photorespiration are sensitive to air pollutants. If the concentration of air pollutants is high, it inhibits respiration whereas at lower concentration stimulates respiration. Nitrogenous air pollutants under chronic exposure increases chlorophyll content while NO2 reduces pigment content at acute exposure.




  

**iv. Edaphic Stress** They are divided into two types. They are water **stress** and **salt stress: a. Water stress** A common stress condition arising from lack of water or excess of water is called **water stress. The abundance of water leads to a stress** called flood stress and scarcity of water leads to a stress called **drought stress**. **I. Flood Stress** The temporary inundation of plants and its parts by flooding causes oxygen deficiency to the roots and soil borne microorganisms. Effects of flooding are as follows: Nitrogen turnover in the soil is reduced; Abscisic acid, ethylene and ethylene precursors are formed in larger amount; Stimulation of partial stomatal closure, epinasty and abscission in leaves; Cellular membrane systems break down, mitochondria and microbodies disintegrate and enzymes are partially inhibited. Flood tolerant plants include those found on permanently wet soils. Examples: Marsh plants, shore plants and hydrophytes. Tree species found dominant in flooded sites are also tolerant. Examples: _Taxodium disticum,_ Mangroves and palms are tolerant to flood stress. **II. Drought Stress** The term ‘drought’ denotes a period without appreciable precipitation, during which the water content of the soil is reduced to such an extent that plants suffer from water deficiency. Effects of drought are as follows: Decrease in cellular growth and synthesis of cell wall components cause the cells to become smaller in size; Nitrogen fixation and its reduction are decreased by decreasing the activity of certain enzymes; Increase in abscisic acid level ultimately closes down the stomatal apparatus to the minimum, hence, transpiration declines; Protochlorophyll formation is inhibited and photosynthetic process declines; ; Wilting in mature leaves is associated with carbohydrate depletion due to mobilization export, followed by leaf senescence.  

**Mechanism of drought resistance** Xerophytes are well adapted for drought either because,

i. the protoplasm of such plants does not die when it faces extreme or prolonged desiccation (dehydration) hence, it tolerates or endures such conditions. Example: Creosote bush (_Larrea tridentata_) can survive water content drops upto 30% whereas, in most plants the lethal level is below 50–70% or these plants are able to avoid or postpone the lethal level of desiccation because they have developed structural or physiological adaptations. Plants have developed following mechanisms:

- To avoid or postpone desiccation improved water uptake by developing the roots to deep water source

- Improved water uptake by roots which penetrate deep water source; Increasing and enlarging the conductive tissues.

- Stomata present only on the lower epidermis with by dense trichomes;

- Rolling of leaves and water storage in succulent tissue.

During drought stress an essential protection mechanism that stabilizes the cell structure is induced gene expression of **stress protein (dehydrin and osmotin)**. These proteins protect the macromolecules in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, the cytoskeleton (biomembranes) against denaturation. High desiccation tolerance implies that the protoplasm rehydrates when water becomes available. Plants growing in deserts and arid regions are usually drought resistant.

Resurrection plants, those plants having ability to survive near total drying which causes them to appear

dead. They recover when water is available. Example: _Selaginella lepidophylla_




  

**b. Salt Stress** Presence of high salt concentration in the soil restricts the growth and development of plants. Most commonly the plants which are present near the seashore and estuaries are subjected to salt stress. According to an estimate about one third of irrigated land on earth is affected by salt stress. Na1, Cl2, K1, Ca11 and Mg11 ions usually contribute to soil salinity. Plants growing in such areas face two problems: 1. Absorption of water from the soil with

negative water potential 2. Interaction with high concentration of

toxic sodium carbonate and chloride ions. On the basis of salt tolerance, they are

grouped into two categories: 1. Halophytes 2. Non-halophytes or glycophytes

Halophytes are native to saline soils. The halophytes which can resist a range of salt concentration are called as **euryhaline** and those with narrow range of resistance are called **stenohaline**. Non-halophytes cannot resist salts as the halophytes. _Helianthus annus tolerates high Mn21 ions. Those which_ are present in salt regions face two problems. 
- One is high concentration of salts in soil

water leads to decrease in water potential so they grow in opposite direction. Example: _Salicornia._

- Injuries in salt affected plants caused by both osmotic effects and specification effects. Accumulation of chloride ions reduces water absorption and transpiration. Salt stress due to deficiency of mineral

elements (K, P, S, Fe, Mo, Zn, Mg, Mn) causes physiological disorders which lead to reduced growth and yields. 1. Salt accumulators absorb and store salts

so that the osmotic potential of their cells continues to remain negative throughout the growing region.

2\. In some salt hardy plants, the excess salt is excluded on the surface of leaves. Some  

plants have salt glands which secrete salt (mostly NaCl). The exuded salt absorbs water hygroscopically from the atmosphere.

3\. Some plants lose their excess salt by leaching into the soil or by dropping their salt filled leaves.

4\. Salt tolerant plants (true halophytes) synthesize large amounts of the amino acid proline, galactosyl glycerol and some organic acids which function in osmotic adjustments.

**Mechanism of salt tolerance** The plants growing in salty habitats like halophytes face the problem of excessive dissolved salts in the solution. Excess of salt creates comparatively more negative osmotic potential so that the plants tend to lose water into surrounding medium. Under such conditions the plants tend to lose water only when their water potential becomes more negative. It is possible only if they absorb excess of salt and accumulate it in their cell saps to maintain the same or higher concentrations as those of outside plants. **The drawbacks:**

1\. Salt accumulates in the vacuoles 2. The plants become succulents 3. Accumulated salt dehydrates the

cytoplasm 4. Sodium chloride cannot be tolerated in

the cytoplasm and it denatures several enzymes

Thus, absorption and accumulation of inorganic salts fail to solve the problem. The plants however tolerate the salt stress by synthesizing organic compounds that can exist at high salt concentrations without denaturing the enzymes. These organic compounds are called **nontoxic organic osmotica**. Examples: Proline and Betalin (osmoregulators).

**Summary** Growth occurs by cell division, cell elongation and cell maturation. The first phase is lag phase, the second is log phase and the final phase is steady state phase. The




  

log phase is otherwise known as **exponential phase. The three phases are collectively** called Grand period of growth. Plant growth and development are controlled by both internal and external factors. The internal factors are chemical substances called Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs). The hormones are classified into five groups: Auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic acid and ethylene. These PGRs are synthesized in various parts of the plant. PGRs may act synergistically or antagonistically. Mechanism of flowering is controlled by light period (photoperiodism) and temperature (vernalization). The physiological changes on flowering with effect from relative length of light and darkness (photoperiodism) are called photoperiodism. A bluish biliprotein responsible for the perception of light in photophysiological process (induction and inhibition of flowering) is called **Phytochrome**. Besides photoperiod certain plants require a low temperature in the earlier stages for flowering. Many biennial and perennial plants are induced to flower by low temperature (0oC to 5oC). This process is called vernalization and the reversal effect of vernalization is called **devernalization**. The condition of a seed when it fails to germinate even in suitable environmental condition is called seed dormancy. Thus, dormancy can be overcome by following methods such as scarification, impaction, stratification, alternating temperatures and light. Senescence refers to all collective, progressive and deteriorative processes which ultimately lead to complete loss of organization and function. Senescence is of four types and they are overall, top, deciduous and progressive. Senescence is controlled by plant’s own genetic programme. Death of the plant or its parts consequent to senescence is called **Programmed Cell Death** (PCD). The final stage of senescence is abscission.  

Abscission is a physiological process of shedding of organs from the parent plant body. The study of functioning of plants under adverse environmental conditions is called stress physiology. The environmental stress may broadly be divided into biotic and abiotic stress. The adverse effect on plants caused by other living organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, insects, weeds is competing plants are called biotic stress. Abiotic stress may occur due to an atmospheric condition or soil condition.
